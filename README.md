Designing of a chess engine in order to understand the concepts of data structures, c, and passion to play chess 
Hoping to first write in python using all sorts of tools from machine learning and then porting it to C. Its a long project thus will definitely take a lot of time.

But before that any contributors are most welcome.
So starting with the design first thing is designing the Board Representation.
